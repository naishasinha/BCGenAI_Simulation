The next highest was also by Tesla, between FY2022 and FY2023, with values of (18.8%) and (18.96%) respectively. Overall, Microsoft had the next highest growth in both Revenue and Net Income, while Apple had the lowest overall Revenue and Net Income growth in all fiscal years. However, it is important to note that while Apple did have the least growth, it stayed consistent in the highest total revenue and net income values for all three fiscal years.\n",

    "In terms of growth patterns between fiscal years, all three companies proved a lower overall growth between FY2022 and FY2023 in comparison to their prior fiscal year comparison. As can be seen in our analysis, both Apple and Microsoft reflected negative growth in this years, with negative net income growth (-0.52%) for Microsoft, and negative growth in both revenue (-2.8%) and net income (-2.81%) for Apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for our derived mean values, Apple has the highest mean revenue (381,143.33M) and net income (79,159.33M) among the fiscal years, as discussed previously. Between Microsoft and Tesla, Microsoft had a much higher mean revenue (192,757.67M) and mean net income (68,790M) than Tesla, which had mean values of (77,352.67M) and (11,086.33M) respectively. "

    "Similar to the previous analysis, the highest growth percentage for Assets, Liabilities, and Cash Flow (Operating) was by Tesla between FY2021 and FY2022, with values of (32.52%), (19.29%), and (28.07%) respectively. However, although the next highest growth in Assets and Liabilities was also by Tesla between FY2022 and FY2023, with values of (29.49%) and (18.03), this was not the case for the Cash Flow Growth (Operating), which actually had the most negative growth across all companies and fiscal years (-9.97%). Instead, the highest Cash Flow Growth (Operating) was by Apple between FY2021 and FY2022 (17.41%). This can be considered an anomaly, as the rest of Apple's growth values in all fiscal years were the lowest across all companies. In fact, we can see that between FY2022 and FY2023, all of Apple's growth percentages for Assets (-0.05%), Liabilities (-3.86%), and Cash Flow (-9.5%) were negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to the previous analysis, in terms of growth patterns between fiscal years, the lowest growth rates were not all constricted to one year. For example, Microsoft had a higher Asset growth (12.92%) and Liability growth (3.76%) between FY2022 and FY2023, but it had a lower Cash Flow Growth for that period, with a negative growth of (-1.63%) vs. its positive growth of (16.02%) between FY2021 and FY2022. We can also conversely see that instead of a higher Asset growth like Microsoft, both Tesla and Apple had a lower Asset growth between FY2022 and FY2023 than FY2021 and FY2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the derived means were also varied among all figures. Microsoft had the highest mean assets (379,198.33M), but Apple had the highest mean liabilites (293,477.33M) and operating cash flow (112,244M)."

    "## Final Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a summarized charts of solely all the calculations we conducted in this notebook. Based off of these numbers and the trends we verbalized earlier, one clear standout was the observed variations in total assets, liabilities, and cash flow from operating activities compared to total revenue and net income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several possibilities can explain this:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revenue and Net Income Trends:\n",
    "Revenue and net income trends showed more consistent growth patterns, particularly for Tesla, which experienced the highest growth rates. This can be attributed to Tesla's aggressive market expansion, increased production capacity, and growing demand for electric vehicles. Conversely, Apple's relatively stable yet high revenue and net income values reflect its established market dominance and mature product lines, which typically see incremental growth rather than rapid increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variability in Assets, Liabilities, and Cash Flow\n",
    "The greater variation in total assets, liabilities, and cash flow from operating activities across fiscal years suggests several underlying factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Investment Strategies:\n",
    "Companies like Tesla, which are in high-growth phases, often see significant fluctuations in assets and liabilities due to ongoing investments in new factories, technologies, and market expansion efforts. These investments can lead to substantial increases in both assets and liabilities as the company finances its growth through both equity and debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Market Conditions:\n",
    "Fluctuations in cash flow from operating activities can be influenced by broader economic conditions, changes in consumer demand, and operational efficiencies. For instance, negative cash flow growth in certain years might reflect periods of heavy investment or downturns in market demand that impact operational revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operational Changes:\n",
    "Variations in cash flow growth could also result from changes in operational efficiency, cost management, and production scaling. Companies like Microsoft, which have diversified product lines and services, might experience variability in cash flow due to shifts in operational focus or the introduction of new products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Financial Management:\n",
    "The differences in mean values and growth rates of liabilities and assets also highlight distinct financial management strategies. Apple, for instance, manages to maintain high cash flow despite lower growth rates, indicating effective cost control and a strong cash reserve strategy. In contrast, Tesla's higher variability reflects its ongoing investment in scaling operations and infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broader Implications\n",
    "Overall, the broader trends observed in the financial data suggest that while revenue and net income provide a snapshot of a company's market performance and profitability, a deeper analysis of assets, liabilities, and cash flow is crucial to understanding the underlying financial health and strategic priorities of the company. The variations in these metrics highlight the dynamic nature of financial management and the impact of strategic decisions on a company's financial trajectory.\n",
